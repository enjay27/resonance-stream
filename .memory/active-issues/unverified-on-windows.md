# Unverified on Windows

> **2026-10-06:** every bullet below is sorted by how it can be checked now (covered by an automatic run / a small extra row / a new bridge command / ui-preview / human only) in [`checklist-triage.md`](checklist-triage.md). Start there.

The Linux cloud sessions cannot build `src-tauri/` (WinDivert, `windows-sys`, GTK
missing). Anything listed here compiled only in CI, or not at all, and has not been
run as the real app.

- **CI workflow (phase 1).** First run (36549688320): Linux job green; Windows job
  **built and linked** `src-tauri` (so the no-Npcap-SDK assumption held) and failed one
  test — a stale mock, fixed 2026-09-29 (see sessions/); run 36551390327 on 182d651
  is fully green, so app build + tests are now verified on Windows. Original note:
  `.github/workflows/ci.yml` had never run. The Windows
  job assumes no Npcap SDK is needed: `pcap` 2.5's build script falls back to version
  1.0.0 when `wpcap.dll` is absent, and nothing links it because no code uses the crate
  (see `unused-deps.md`). If the job fails on linking, that assumption is the first suspect.
  It also relies on a placeholder `dist/index.html` for `generate_context!`.
- **Phase 2 (`crates/core`, `crates/types`).** `cargo check` of the app for
  `x86_64-pc-windows-gnu` passes (19 warnings vs 22 before — the removed ones were
  unused imports of moved code). Not run: app tests (`translator` mock-server test),
  linking, and the app itself. Wire format: the ui's `ChatMessage` now also carries
  `unknownFields` (the app always sent it; the ui used to ignore it).
- **Phase 3 (`lib.rs` split).** Cross-check only. Worth a real run: tray menu (all four
  items), global tab shortcut, Exit → `llama-server.exe` killed. These are the paths
  whose code moved.
- **Phase 4 (`App` / `Settings` split).** wasm check only; the UI has not been opened.
  Worth a click-through: first-run wizard download, settings modal (each section,
  close/reopen keeps typed keyword and last export result), app/model update modals,
  tray toggles reflected in the UI.
- **Phase 5a (version source).** `tauri.conf.json` no longer has `"version"`; Tauri should
  fall back to src-tauri's Cargo version (0.4.0, inherited from the workspace). Check
  the NSIS installer name/version and that the update check still reads 0.4.0
  (`app.package_info().version` in `downloader/gist.rs`). `Cargo.lock` was generated in
  this session from the local registry cache — Kade's previous local lock was untracked,
  so its exact versions may differ.
- **Review fixes (2026-09-29, fbfd552..HEAD).** Core logic is tested on Linux (78 + 8 UI
  + 3 types tests); app wiring is cross-checked and CI-built only. Worth a real run:
  chat capture incl. long/bursty world chat (new framing -- confirm with a captured
  fixture), translation on/off/tier change (one llama-server, new port if 8080 busy,
  Exit kills it), dictionary edit applies without restart, model/app/AI-engine
  download (`.part` then rename; engine zip hash pinned), archive now in the app data
  folder, block/unblock, restart sniffer, tab/search/unread badges.
- **feat/ui-improve port (2026-09-29, a5b1966..).** Cross-checked only. Worth a real run:
  firewall-missing → setup wizard; model download skip when the hash matches; restart
  with archiving on reloads chat (no duplicates after re-login); right-click tab menu
  (limits, archive toggle, custom channels); message spacing; window position restored;
  no silent dictionary sync unless auto-sync is on.
- **Translation ledger (2026-09-30, `claude/translation-ledger`).** Core tested on Linux
  (`workers::TranslationLedger`, `load_recent` dedup); app cross-checked (incl. `--tests`).
  Worth a real run: with translation off, collect some Japanese chat, turn it on -- the
  badge shows CATCHING UP, then those rows get translations (newest 100); new chat during
  the catch-up is translated without waiting; a tier change mid-catch-up stops the old
  worker; with archiving on, a restart reloads each caught-up message once.
- **Favorite messages (2026-09-30, `claude/favorite-messages`).** Core/types/ui tests on
  Linux; app cross-checked (incl. `--tests`) only. Worth a real run, as Administrator:
  ⭐ in the nav controls opens the list; 📋 copies; ✏️ edits text + records a shortcut
  (modifier required, F-keys alone OK; conflicts with tab-switch/another favorite refused);
  add / 🗑 (click twice). With the game focused and its chat box open, the shortcut
  should paste the message (clipboard + synthetic Ctrl+V on key release). **Open risk:**
  the game or its anti-cheat may ignore `SendInput` -- if so, text is still on the
  clipboard. Also: changing the tab-switch shortcut must keep favorite shortcuts working
  (all shortcuts now re-registered together in `shortcut.rs::apply_global_shortcuts`).
- **Chat log retention (2026-09-30, `claude/chat-log-retention`).** Core tested on Linux
  (`history::expired_chat_logs`), ui + app cross-checked. Worth a real run: Settings →
  데이터 → "채팅 로그 보관 기간" 2 deletes older `chat_logs/*.jsonl` on save, at start-up
  and at midnight while archiving; 0 deletes nothing; `dataset_raw.jsonl` is untouched.
- **Favorites follow-up (2026-09-30, `claude/favorites-notes-guard`).** Same gates as above.
  Worth a real run: ⭐ on a chat row (hover, both normal and compact view) adds the
  message with its translation as the note, a second ⭐ on the same text adds nothing;
  a quick double press of a favorite shortcut pastes once; after a paste in the game the
  clipboard holds what it held before (500 ms `CLIPBOARD_RESTORE_DELAY` in
  `shortcut.rs` -- if the game pastes the *old* text, raise it). Configs saved by #32
  keep their entries without notes (defaults only apply to a fresh config).
- **N11/N12/N13 (2026-09-30, `claude/review-n11-n12-n13`).** Core + ui tested on Linux,
  app cross-checked (incl. `--tests`). The sniffer restart badge was run on Windows by Kade
  (2026-10-01): works. Still worth a real run: with archiving on, a busy WORLD day no longer pushes GUILD/PARTY
  out of the reloaded history (each channel reloads up to its own tab limit); a blocked
  sender's message raises no unread badge.
- **llama client timeouts (2026-09-30, `claude/integration-test-harness`).** The
  translator worker and `wait_for_server` use `resonance_llama::client()` (2 s connect,
  30 s request); an empty model reply is a failed job. Tested against a mock server on
  Linux; app cross-checked only, not run against a real llama-server.

- **Beginner channel (2026-10-01, `claude/beginner-channel`).** Core/ui/app-cross gates green; not run on Windows: the new 초보자 tab (nav, 🌱 icon, unread badge, colours), its limit and archive entries in the right-click menu, the custom-tab list showing BEGINNER, and the tab-switch shortcut cycle (now six tabs). Beginner lines from old logs stay WORLD.

- **Core-review leftovers (2026-10-01, `claude/core-review-leftovers`).** Core gate green (W4, W6, W7 tested). Not run on Windows: W9 (the sniffer loop backing off on a failing socket read -- nothing tests a failing socket) and W8 (translator retry when llama-server exits while loading: try a bad model file or a taken port and watch for "Retrying in Ns..." then the Error after 3 tries).

- **Settings sidebar + window grow (2026-09-30, `claude/settings-sidebar`).** Core/ui/app-cross gates green; the new layout was screenshotted in Chromium with the wasm build and a mocked `__TAURI__` (grow on open, restore with the returned rect on close). Not run on Windows: `grow_window`/`restore_window` on a real monitor (DPI scaling, work area with the taskbar, a second monitor), the transparent overlay while enlarged. Known gap: closing the app while settings is open leaves the enlarged size for `tauri-plugin-window-state` to save.

- **System-log dedup (`claude/log-spam-dedup`, 2026-10-02).** Core gate green (`log_throttle`, 9 tests); app cross-check only. Worth a real run: leave the game idle in a lobby for 2+ minutes -- the system tab should show one "No game traffic for 15s." and then "(repeated N more times)" about a minute later, not a line every 15 s; start the translator and check the system tab no longer fills with "Polling .../health..." (set log level to trace).
- **Firewall rule per exe (2026-10-02, `candidate/firewall-per-exe`).** Cross-checked only; `netsh` was never run. Check on Windows: (1) `cargo tauri dev` -> wizard -> allow -> chat is captured; (2) run the installed/release exe -> the wizard appears once (its rule does not exist yet) -> allow -> captured; (3) back to dev: no wizard, still captured (`netsh advfirewall firewall show rule name=all | findstr "Packet Sniffing"` lists two rules, each with its own `Program:`); (4) the old un-hashed rule is gone after the first setup.

- **Main UI redesign (`candidate/main-ui-a-cb`, 2026-10-01).** Screenshotted in
  `ui-preview` only. Worth a real run: transparency at low opacity (text boxes), title
  bar / nav drag regions, compact bar hover-reveal (and leaving compact from it), pin,
  tab right-click menu, sender menu (copy / filter / block), star + copy on hover.
- **rc UI fixes (`claude/rc-build-ui-fixes-ny8j3w`, 2026-10-01).** ui-preview only. Worth a
  real run: the folded tools (hover / click, panel below the bar), the compact button by
  close in the title bar, star + copy beside each compact message, and that rows keep
  their size when the opacity slider crosses 50 %.
- **Favorite tabs (`claude/rc-build-ui-fixes-ny8j3w`, 2026-10-01).** ui-preview only; the
  `src-tauri` change (`favorite_tabs` in `AppConfig`, one test) was only type-checked
  (`just app-cross-check` and `cargo check --tests` for windows-gnu). Worth a real run: add a
  tab with and without the defaults, delete one, restart and check the tabs and shortcuts
  survive, a shortcut set on a tab message still pastes in-game.
- **Cheat sheet (`claude/rc-build-ui-fixes-ny8j3w`, 2026-10-01).** ui-preview only. Worth a real run:
  the book button in the title bar (not a drag region), the modal over the transparent
  window, click-to-copy of a JP name.
- **Chat row menus + add to dictionary (`claude/rc-build-ui-fixes-ny8j3w`, 2026-10-01).** ui-preview
  only. Worth a real run: the pointer and underline on the message text, selecting a word and
  clicking (the menu keeps the selection), double click, a click after a drag-to-scroll opening
  nothing, "사전에 추가" saving and the next translation using the term (and `auto_sync_latest_dict`
  overwriting it), copy / favorite feedback.
- **Japanese study view (2026-10-02).** `annotate_furigana` and the `translation_view`
  config field were cross-checked for `x86_64-pc-windows-gnu` only; the app tests (incl.
  `the_translation_view_shows_translations_when_missing_and_round_trips`) run on Windows
  CI. Worth a real run: the badge picker, 공부 모드 (ruby over kanji, hover shows the
  translation, normal + compact), the first-line latency (dictionary loads on first use).
  Seen by Kade (2026-10-02, 0.6.0): the badge and ruby over kanji. The release exe is 59 MB
  with the embedded IPADIC.
- **Route-based interface pick (2026-10-02, `candidate/route-interface-pick`).** Core-tested (`pick_interface`), app cross-checked only. Check on Windows: (1) two live adapters (Ethernet + Wi-Fi) -> the system tab says `Auto-Targeting Network Interface: <ip> (default route)` and that is the adapter the game uses (`ipconfig` / `route print 0.0.0.0`), capture works without the manual picker; (2) a full-tunnel VPN on: the pick is the physical adapter, `(first physical adapter)`, and capture still works (this is the open question -- if packets are seen on the VPN adapter instead, the virtual-adapter rule is wrong); (3) offline: no crash, falls back to the list. **CI note:** this branch's gate ran in a session that cannot download lindera's dictionary -- core tests (196, furigana module excluded) and the app cross-check ran with the furigana dependency cut out in the working tree only; CI is the first full run.
- **Signed app updates (2026-10-02, v0.6.0).** The 0.5.0 -> 0.6.0 hop through the gist ran
  0.5.0's old code, so none of the new path has run: the feed (`latest.json`), signature check,
  verify-before-swap, the dialog's error step, the backup key. **A5 is verified (2026-10-04, Kade's PC); A1-A4 need a set-up app, not a fresh copy -- see `sessions/2026-10-04-w1-notebooks-handoff.md`.** Checks A1-A5 in
  [`sessions/2026-10-02-0.6.0-windows-verification-handoff.md`](../sessions/2026-10-02-0.6.0-windows-verification-handoff.md);
  A1 needs a release newer than 0.6.0.
- **Cheat sheet as a popup window (2026-10-03, `claude/popup-window-cheatsheet`).** Types (`PopupKind`, 5 tests) and the view choice (`popup_view`, 5 tests) are tested; the UI compiles for wasm and was screenshotted in `ui-preview` (`?popup=cheatsheet`); the app (`open_popup` in `window.rs`, `popup-*` in `capabilities/default.json`) is cross-checked incl. `--tests` only -- **no real window has been created.** Check on Windows (`cargo tauri dev` as Administrator): (1) the book button in the title bar opens a separate "직업 · 던전 이름" window (about 420x560, normal title bar, resizable) and the chat behind it stays visible and clickable -- no dark backdrop; (2) pressing the book button again brings the same window to the front, never a second one; (3) the page shows the list with the app's theme, search works, a click on a Japanese name copies it (paste it into the game chat or Notepad); (4) pin the main window (always on top) -> the popup is on top too, unpin -> it is not; (5) minimize or close the main window -> the popup goes with it; (6) close the popup with its X, open it again: it comes back at the size and place you left it; (7) if the page is blank or the list is empty, open DevTools in the popup (right click > Inspect) and send me the console text -- a missing permission would show up as "not allowed".
- **Favorites as a popup window + sync (2026-10-03, `claude/popup-window-favorites`).** Tested: `FavoritesState` (types), `AppConfig::keeping_favorites_of` / `with_favorites` (app, run by Windows CI), `ConfigSignals::apply_favorites` (ui). Screenshotted in `ui-preview` (`?popup=favorites`: edit -> `save_favorites`, never `save_config`). The `favorites-changed` event and the real second window have not run. Check on Windows (`cargo tauri dev`, Administrator): (1) the star next to the tools opens a separate "자주 쓰는 메시지" window; the chat stays visible; pressing the star again focuses it; (2) **two-way sync:** with the popup open, use a chat message's menu > "자주 쓰는 메시지에 추가" -> the new entry appears in the popup without reopening it; and add / edit / delete / add a tab in the popup -> close it, reopen: it stayed; (3) **no overwrite:** with the popup open, change a setting in the main window (e.g. the opacity slider, save), then edit a favorite in the popup -> the setting is still the new one (check `config.json` or restart); (4) shortcuts: record a shortcut in the popup, then in the game chat press it -> the message pastes, as before; deleting the entry frees the shortcut; a shortcut that equals the tab-switch keys is refused; (5) recording a shortcut inside the popup does not trigger the global shortcut; (6) restart the app: favorites and tabs are all there; (7) if something is blank or "not allowed", Inspect the popup and send me the console text.
- **Popup polish (2026-10-03, `claude/popup-window-polish`; Kade tried the first popups on Windows: both open and look right).** New: no native title bar (the page draws one like the main window's: title, version, minimize, close), popups are created hidden ~2 s after start-up (`prewarm_popups`) and restored to their saved size/place *before* they are shown, closing hides instead of destroys, and closing the main window destroys them. Cross-checked only. Check on Windows: (1) about 2 s after the app starts, both popups exist hidden (Task Manager: two more `msedgewebview2` processes -- note their memory and tell me); (2) the first open of each is instant and appears **at its saved place, no jump from the default place** (move it, close it, close the app, start again, open it); (3) the bar looks like the main one; dragging it moves the window; minimize works; the X hides it and the next open is instant and in the same place; Alt+F4 on a popup hides it too; (4) the edges still resize the window (undecorated); (5) **exit:** closing the main window (X) really ends the app -- no `resonance-stream.exe` left in Task Manager, and llama-server gone; the tray Exit works; (6) opening a popup after changing a setting in the main window shows the new theme / tab-switch keys (the `popup-shown` refresh); (7) a pinned main window keeps the pre-created popups on top.
- **Favorites as an editable table (2026-10-03, `claude/favorites-table`).** Pure edit rules tested (`favorites::set_field`, `indices_in_tab`, `new_message`); the table was driven in `ui-preview` (edit / refuse / Esc / shortcut record, clear, conflict / blank-row add / two-click delete). Not run on Windows: (1) click the Japanese or Korean box of a row, type, press Enter -> kept (the row does not jump); click away also keeps; Esc undoes; an emptied message box comes back with an error; (2) the shortcut box: click, press e.g. Alt+F5 -> it shows "Alt + F5"; Backspace/Delete clears to "단축키 미지정"; a combination already used by another favorite or the tab-switch keys shows the red line; (3) **the shortcut still pastes into the game chat** after editing it in the table (the backend re-registers on every save); (4) the blank row at the end: type a message, Enter -> a new row appears and the blank row is empty again; (5) 📋 copies (paste it in Notepad); 🗑 asks "삭제?" and the second click deletes; (6) with the main window open, add a favorite from a chat message's menu -> the new row shows in the table without reopening; (7) tabs: switch, add, delete as before (a duplicate tab name is still refused until the position-keys PR).
- **Esc closes a popup window (2026-10-04, `claude/popup-escape-closes`).** Rule tested (`popup_view::escape_closes_popup`), flows driven in `ui-preview`; the real windows not run. Check on Windows (`cargo tauri dev`): (1) open the cheat sheet, click inside it, press Esc -> it hides; open it again -> it is back at its place; (2) same for the favorites window; (3) in the favorites table, edit a box and press Esc -> the edit is undone and the window stays; a second Esc closes it; (4) the shortcut box recording: Esc cancels the recording only; (5) the add-tab and the delete-tab question: Esc closes the question only; (6) type Korean in a box (IME composing) and press Esc -> the composition is cancelled, the window stays; (7) with the main window focused, Esc does nothing new.
