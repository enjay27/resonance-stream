"""Pipeline `chat-rules`: what the backend does with chat lines, tried with no game.

Lines go in through `replay-chat` (they enter at the same place a captured line does, after the parser), commands come in
over the bridge (`block-user`, `unblock-user`, `get-chat-history`, `clear-history`: the ones the chat row's menu and the clear button
call), and what comes out is read from the events the app publishes. Rows:

  CR-dedupe       a line sent twice (same sender, time and sequence) and the same line from a second client (same sender, text
                  and time, another sequence) are each shown once
  CR-history      the backend's chat log is what was published, in order (what the window reads when it starts)
  CR-block        blocking a sender flags the rows already there (`chat-message-update`) and no other sender's
  CR-block-later  a line from a blocked sender that arrives afterwards is flagged
  CR-unblock      unblocking takes the flag off again
  CR-clear        clearing the history empties the log

And the Study view's furigana (`annotate-furigana`, the app's `annotate_furigana`; nine lines, one of them empty):

  CR-ruby-answer   one list of spans per line, in order, and nothing for the empty line
  CR-ruby-join     the spans of a line, joined, are the line (nothing lost, nothing added)
  CR-ruby-plain    a line without kanji is one plain span, no reading
  CR-ruby-reading  a line with kanji has readings, and they are hiragana
  CR-ruby-probe    what the built exe reads for 一人, 二人, 一人前 (roadmap K16: IPADIC said イチ ニン): a measurement, so it passes
                   whenever the answer is consistent; the readings are the evidence, and whether an override list is needed is
                   Kade's call

`min_sender_level` is the window's filter, not the backend's (the backend publishes every line), so it is not tested here.
