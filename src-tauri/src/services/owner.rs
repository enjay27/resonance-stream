//! The one owner of the background services' lifetime (review R-1, W-10): who is running, and the
//! only code that starts, stops or restarts them. Every path that used to take the slot by hand --
//! start-up, the translator command, a settings change, the model swap -- goes through here, so the
//! rules (an old worker is dropped before a new one starts, a stopped worker is retired) live in one
//! place instead of four slightly different copies.
//!
//! A sniffer restart waits for the old capture thread to end before the new one starts (they used to
//! overlap, each with its own pipeline, so a chat packet in the overlap could be shown twice).
